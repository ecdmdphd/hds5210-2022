    "\n",
    "This project examines data about osteoporosis in women in the United States using 2 data sources: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). While NHANES is continuously run, SWAN was most recently conducted between 2006-2008. Thus, the present project focuses on NHANES 2007-2008 and 2006-2008 data. \n",

    "## Study Objectives\n",
    "I will be working with a medical student for her 2022 Summer Research Fellowship to examine associations between osteoporosis and mental health, with a particular focus on mental health treatment and gender disparities. We plan to use secondary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey comprised of in-home questionnaires and physical examinations administered at a mobile site. We will examine a subset of individuals with osteoporosis for mental health outcomes and treatment. In particular, we will use the data on osteoporosis outcomes (such as broken bones and diagnosis), general impression of mental health, and PHQ-9 scores (a commonly used screening tool for depression). Treatment data could be gathered from reports of prescription medication and mental health encounters in other modules of NHANES not included above. The larger project will include NHANES data from multiple years, using those years in which NHANES collected data on osteoporosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As no one dataset contains all the information one typically needs, cross-comparison between two similar data sources is often required. The current project will focus on proor-of-concept, data management, and exploratory analysis. In addition, I will compare data from NHANES with SWAN to determine whether NHANES gathers comparable information to SWAN, a longitudinal in-person study. From the current project, I will identify variables that could be harmonized and compared between the two data sources. This cross-sectional analysis will be the first step towards future comparisons between these two data sets, including later longitudinal study. This will be particularly useful as SWAN stopped collecting data in 2008, while NHANES continues to collect data. If the conclusions drawn from both studies are similar regarding women's mental health and osteoporosis outcomes, NHANES would be a good candidate data source to continue to monitor national trends in these areas. If these conclusions are different, the necessity of longitudinal studies such as SWAN would be underscored."
