    "### 47.1: Filtering and summarizing data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this work, you'll find a data file in `/data/complications_all.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the data file and create a variable called `mo_hospitals` that contains a data frame from the `complications_all.csv` file, filtered down to only contain those hospitals from the state of Missouri (MO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then aggregate that data by hospital into a variable named `mo_summary`.  There are some key fields that we want to summarize:\n",
    "* We want to know the earliest date that each hospital was participating in any program\n",
    "* We want to know the latest date that each hospital stopped participating in any program\n",
    "* We want to know the total number of patients in the denominators of these programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note:\n",
    "* You will need to convert the `Start Date` and `End Date` to actual datetime fields\n",
    "* You will need to clean up and convert the `Denominator` field to just be numeric - the rule that you should use it to simply remove any records where the `Denominator` is `'Not Available'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of this step should be a new data frame called `mo_summary` that contains one row for each hospital and contains the min start date, max end date, and total denominator.  Use the names `start_date`, `end_date`, and `number` for those columns in `mo_summary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to create your code in the form of a function, just make sure your variable names match what I've described above so the tests work."

NHANES collects information on a variety of topics, including mental health, general health, social determinants of health (i.e. insurance, education, citizenship status, etc.), and other demographic information. Unique participant IDs are assigned and can be used to merge data from different modules. Below are the modules I intend to use for this project: \n",

    "I will be working with a medical student for her 2022 Summer Research Fellowship to examine associations between osteoporosis and mental health, with a particular focus on mental health treatment and gender disparities. We plan to use secondary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey comprised of in-home questionnaires and physical examinations administered at a mobile site. We will examine a subset of individuals with osteoporosis for mental health outcomes and treatment. In particular, we will use the data on osteoporosis outcomes (such as broken bones and diagnosis), general impression of mental health, and PHQ-9 scores (a commonly used screening tool for depression). Treatment data could be gathered from reports of prescription medication and mental health encounters in other modules of NHANES not included above. The larger project will include NHANES data from multiple years, using those years in which NHANES collected data on osteoporosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "As no one dataset contains all the information one typically needs, cross-comparison between two similar data sources is often required. The current project will focus on proor-of-concept, data management, and exploratory analysis. In addition, I will compare data from NHANES with SWAN to determine whether NHANES gathers comparable information to SWAN, a longitudinal in-person study. From the current project, I will identify variables that could be harmonized and compared between the two data sources. This cross-sectional analysis will be the first step towards future comparisons between these two data sets, including later longitudinal study. This will be particularly useful as SWAN stopped collecting data in 2008, while NHANES continues to collect data. If the conclusions drawn from both studies are similar regarding women's mental health and osteoporosis outcomes, NHANES would be a good candidate data source to continue to monitor national trends in these areas. If these conclusions are different, the necessity of longitudinal studies such as SWAN would be underscored."
